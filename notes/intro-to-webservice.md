# Intro to Web Services

## What is a Web Service?
A web service is a generic term for an interoperable machine-to-machine software function that is hosted from a network addressable location.  
 - **interoperable** - different languages, hardware, environments, able to operate together thanks to some clearly defined communication protocol
 - **network addressable** - remote, available over a network.
  
A web service has an interface, which hides the implementation details so that it can be used independently of the hardware or software platform on which it is implemented, and independently of the programming language in which it is written.  
  
The idea is that a wide range of compatible machines can remotely access some functionality and/or resources by defining language and hardware agnostic protocols. 

## Communication
In order to achieve interoperability we need to define a communication protocol. We need a way of structuring and encoding information so machines can parse messages sent. Two popular web service protocols are SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). SOAP is more sophisticated and rigidly defined, and the result is more robust. We will be focusing more on JSON, which is less formally defined and lightweight.
