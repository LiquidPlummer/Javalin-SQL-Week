# Intro to Web Services

## What is a Web Service?
A web service is a generic term for an interoperable machine-to-machine software function that is hosted from a network addressable location.  
 - **interoperable** - different languages, hardware, environments, able to operate together thanks to some clearly defined communication protocol
 - **network addressable** - remote, available over a network.
  
A web service has an interface, which hides the implementation details so that it can be used independently of the hardware or software platform on which it is implemented, and independently of the programming language in which it is written.  
  
The idea is that a wide range of compatible machines can remotely access some functionality and/or resources by defining language and hardware agnostic protocols. 

## SOAP
In order for web services to work, you need to be able to send and recieve data to a remote machine. Both sides must be able to parse and understand this data. A popular protocol for web services is SOAP.
